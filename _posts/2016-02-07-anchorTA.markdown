As a followup to my previous post on [Threat Analysis]({% post_url 2016-01-16-threat-analysis %})
I started working through a simple TA process for [Anchor]({% post_url 2016-01-20-ephemeral-pki %})
with a view to seeing how long the process takes as well as trying to
understand how we should document the steps that are required. I think
we need to end up with a point by point guide to TA, some simple process
that is repeatable and somewhat deterministic.

A good measure of the quality of this documentation would be to have two
groups of developers from the same project attempt to perform TA in
parallel and compare the results.

We are still working on the process as can been seen from this review.

## Reference architectures

One of the problems when trying to work out how to create threat
analysis documentation for OpenStack services is that they can be
configured in so many different ways. Anchor is probably one of the
least complicated services in the ecosystem, capable of being deployed
in a completely stand alone, single service, single host configuration.
However, this is not how it's intended to be used 'in production'. The
expectation is that developers use best judgement on what the best
practice architecture should look like, what components should be
present and what should be optional or recommended. You can see this in
the architecture diagram for Anchor below. I decided to represent the
system in an HA configuration but with LDAP and the audit queue as
optional components. The uses, threats to and protections for the
optional components will be included in the TA but the notation will
highlight that Anchor does not explicitly require these services to run.

## Anchor components

In this diagram you can see that a typical Anchor deployment typically
consists of just a load balancer, a couple of Anchor instances and the
Anchor configuration file which is stored on disk.

The interface list in this diagram doesn't contain a lot of information
but it's really just there for a quick reference.

## Security Requirements

For each component we like to run through a list of basic security
considerations these are at a minimum **Confidentiality**, **Integrity** and
**Availability** (C.I.A) - bonus points are awarded for including
**Authorization**, **Authentication** and **Auditability**.

**Artefact** - Generic term for a given component, interface or asset.

- **Confidentiality:** Does this artefact include or access information that
should be kept secret - could this information be used to compromise the
security or integrity of the system. In the context of the
Anchor project, the on disk config, validators and AuthN information stored
on-disk (c4) and read through interface (5) contain confidential information.
- **Integrity:** Does this artefact include or access information that it's
critical remains correct? Often it is the case that components that have strong
confidentiality requirements will also have strong integrity requirements but
there are times where strong integrity requirements can exist without
confidentiality. Consider a time signal that a service relies on for
synchronisation - the time of day is in no way confidential or sensitive
however it's critical to the process that the integrity of the time signal is
preserved.
- **Availability:** Will the system overall fail if this component, interface or
asset is momentarily unavailable - what is the impact of a potential failure?
- **Authentication:** Does the artefact involve or require authentication for
some or all operations - what is the impact of the authentication system
failing.
- **Authorization:** Once an entity has authenticated (the system knows the
  identity of the user) - is it authorized to perform an action. What happens
  if an authorization failure allows all users to perform actions?
- **Auditability:** Sometimes also considered as **non-repudiation** (I wont go
  into the difference here) is the ability of the system to maintain a immutable
  log of operations and events that occurred with a level of granularity that
  allows an investigator to reconstruct any given series of events.


## Discussion / Dissection

At this point in the review it's time to talk about the block diagram. What data
travels between components and what happens to that data within each component.
Reviews should consider and capture:

- What a reference architecture looks like and what parts are optional
- The interfaces between components, what data travels over those
interfaces
- The security requirements for each interface
- The protocols used

The content of this discussion should be used to inform the component and
interface lists as shown below. Consideration should be given to

### Reference Architecture Validation
**Does the presented architecture make sense as a reference for future
deployer?**
Yes - the block diagram uses dotted line objects to denote optional components.
These components should be present in a strong and robust deployment of Anchor
but are not required for a basic / test deployment.


## Component list

A component list is particularly useful for large projects as it helps
keep track of all the different parts of a system under review. The component
list describes the entities in the system and how they might process and
persist data.

| ID | Name | Purpose | Persists Sensitive Data | Exposed Protocols |
| -- | ---- | ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| c1 | Client System | Any server or service that requires a certificate for operations. | Yes - stores certificates from Anchor as well as it's own private keys. | TLS / 443 |
| c2 | Load Balancer | Not strictly required for Anchor but strongly advisable. This component balances traffic between two or more instances of Anchor | No - Passes data between Anchor instances and clients. | TLS / 443 |
| c3 | Anchor Instance | To validate certificate requests and generate certificates based on request data. |  Yes - Anchor reads configuration data from disk but does not store anything locally other than log caches when the audit stream isn't available | TLS / 443 |
| c4 | Configuration File | To store configuration information |Anchor never writes to this file. It reads lots of sensitive data from the file including validation rules and credentials | Filesystem DAC |
| c5 | Audit Queue | To receive, process and forward log data from Anchor instances. | Anchor emits no sensitive log data. Audit data contains: which host was issued a certificate, the type of authentication used and the validation rules that were met.  Depending on configuration the audit stream data may be logged in it's pre-processed form. Alternatively the representation within a target log management or SEIM application my be persisted. | Unsure |
| c6 | LDAP Server | Anchor can use LDAP to simply authenticate a request or can use group membership as part of validation rules. I.E only a user in the "Nova Engineering" group is allowed to generate certificates matching the "*.compute.cloud" schema | LDAP undoubtedly stores sensitive data however no sensitive data is persisted in LDAP by Anchor or by any side affect of Anchor running. | Unsure |



## Interface List

The interface list describes how these
components communicate with each other.

| ID | Name | Purpose | Protocol(s)| Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability | Boundaries |
| -- | ---- | ------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1-2 | Client to Load Balancer | The client connection to Anchor. Although this goes to a load balancer first, the client perception is that they are connecting directly with an Anchor instance | REST or CMC - both over TLS | Access credentials are passed over this connection. The credentials are not encrypted but the connection is. | Integrity of requests is important and protected by TLS. | Availability of 2 is important - this is why a LB is used in front of Anchor. Potentially two LB could be deployed with a DNS round-robin configuration | Public / Edge Network -> Control Plane |
| 3-4 | Load Balancer to Anchor Instance | This is the main communication channel for Anchor operations. The data from the client is passed to anchor over TLS from the load balancer. | REST or CMC - both over TLS (whatever was provided over 1-2) | See 1-2 | See 1-2 | See 1-2 | Public Facing / Edge Network -> Internal Network / Control Plane |
| 5 | Disk Read | Anchor reads configuration data from disk. This data can contain AD credentials, validation rules etc. Appropriate DAC and MAC should be set | FS Reads | High | High | Low/Med - Anchor requires access to this file only when the service starts | Entirely within control plane |
| 6 | Audit Stream | To log events from Anchor | CADF | Low - no sensitive data in logs although in aggregate logs could provide an attacker with an understanding on the layout of the infrastructure | High | Medium | Within control plane |
| 7 | LDAP connection | To authenticate users and verify that the group they reside in matches what's required in validation rules | LDAP over TLS | High | High | High | Internal Network / Control Plane -> External corporate network |


The next step in the process is to generate sequence diagrams for a
selection of common or important operations within the system under
review. This is again where the process relies on the best judgement of
the reviewers - to generate enough sequence diagrams to map out major
functionality or to ensure that the various interfaces in the reference
architecture are explored.
